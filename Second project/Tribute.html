            <p class="Para">Mother Teresa, born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, in Skopje (modern-day North Macedonia), was a Roman Catholic nun and missionary known for her selfless service to the poor and destitute. At the age of 18, she joined the Loreto Sisters in Ireland and later moved to India, where she dedicated her life to helping those in need.
                In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, an organization devoted to caring for "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers," and all those suffering from neglect and poverty. Her work began in the slums of Calcutta (now Kolkata) and expanded globally, with over 4,500 nuns operating in more than 130 countries.
                Her unwavering compassion and devotion earned her numerous accolades, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and India's Bharat Ratna in 1980. Despite facing criticism for her views on certain social issues, she remained steadfast in her mission of love and service.
                Mother Teresa passed away on September 5, 1997, but her legacy continues to inspire millions. She was canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta by Pope Francis in 2016.</p>
